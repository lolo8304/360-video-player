# 360-video-player
360 video player with 2nd screen feature via websockets for public events and simple video distribution.
Samsung Gear VR is a great tool to use to show 360-videos at events. Most of the visitors have never used a professional head mounted dislay before. 

## Why building an own player?
- most of the VR players are very complex and need assistance for every customer
- an event is too short to introduce Gear VR toolset and its usage
- most of the players eo pause stop if HMD is taken off and do not continue automatically
- 2nd screen feature to show on rxternal TV needs additional setup on the Android device to use Chromecast with Samsung Gear VR
